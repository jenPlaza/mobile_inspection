Make the HTML file look as similar as possible as the attached screenshot saved in the "SCREENSHOTS" folder. Image: Design-Mockup. Do not need to finish it, but will pay attention how how much was done during the given time.

- It's main measurements are for iPads, but extra points if mobile responsive
- The left sidebar has to be "scrollable"
- Basic stylesheet, images and font are included in the Zip file
- You can use Bootstrap, but pure and basic HTML5 / CSS3 would be great
- The map on the right of the mockup is a placeholder
